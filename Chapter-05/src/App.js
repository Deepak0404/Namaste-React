Destructuring:
    const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const { a, b } = obj;
    // is equivalent to:
    // const a = obj.a;
    // const b = obj.b;

Vertiual DOM: 
    - Virtual dom is the concept of software engineering 
    - It's representation of real DOM in our code
    - Vertiual DOM uses Reconcilation
    - Reconcialation uses diff algorithm that finds out the diffrence bwt DOM trees and checks which part needs to update
    - It will rerender only the specific portion of the code which is found by diff algorithm
    - It only update which part of DOM is changed (like git diff) to track the updated part we use unique keys

React Fiber:
    React 16 diff algorithm changed by react fiber that is new reconcilation engine
